Multi line ellipsis Angular directive
-------------------------------------

This is a reusable angular directive that provide support for multiline ellipsis
It is based on the isea presented at https://www.mobify.com/blog/multiline-ellipsis-in-pure-css/

Note: this implementation assumes that the content wraps and uses height to determine overflow situation. 
In cases where content gets truncated due to its width, this implementation is not good enough.

See samples: http://lee-elenbaas.github.io/angular-multiline-ellipsis/sample/sample.html
